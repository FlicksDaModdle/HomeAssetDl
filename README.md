Downloads assets, with options, from a certain monster pet storage service.

Just run the script, and follow the instructions in the window, if you know what ur using this for you should be able to know the option stuff.

Thanks to ChicoEevee for their MD_AssetbundleVer.snd file version script thingy, allows this to work solely on internet and no other files.
