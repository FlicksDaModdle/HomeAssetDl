# HomeAssetDl
Downloads assets, with options, from a certain monster pet storage service.

Just run the script, and follow the instructions in the window, if you know what ur using this for you should be able to know the option stuff.

Thanks to ChicoEevee for their MD_AssetbundleVer.snd file version script thingy, allows this to work solely on internet and no other files.


BTW, in the future, as long as The Big Guys don't change the way the app handles, when there are eventually 20 file versions, the program won't download any more than that. Just put an issue and Ill expand that value to 40 for now.
